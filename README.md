Daence -- Deterministic Authenticated Encryption with no noNCEnse
=================================================================

Taylor ‘Riastradh’ Campbell <campbell+daence@mumble.net>

**Daence** is a deterministic authenticated cipher built out of
Poly1305 and either Salsa20 or ChaCha.  This repository contains the
source code for https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/067 -- the definition,
security analysis, reference implementation, and test vectors for
Daence -- as well as implementations in C (based on primitives in
either NaCl/TweetNaCl, SUPERCOP, libsodium, or BearSSL), Go,
JavaScript, and Rust, and a toy implementation in Python.

- **WARNING: Daence is new and this software has only been lightly tested.**

## Usage

If you and your friend share a secret 96-byte key for Salsa20-Daence:

- You can feed a header and a payload of up to 2^38 bytes into
  Daence-Encrypt, which will return an authenticated ciphertext
  concealing the payload; you can then send it to your friend in an
  envelope with the header on it in the clear.

  > c = Daence-Encrypt(key, header, payload)

- Your friend can feed the header and authenticated ciphertext into
  Daence-Decrypt, which either returns the payload, if it was genuine,
  or reports a forgery, if it was not.  (Your friend must immediately
  drop forgeries on the floor and forget about them.)

  > payload = Daence-Decrypt(key, header, c) or raise Forgery!

Unlike AES-GCM, ChaCha/Poly1305, or crypto_secretbox_xsalsa20poly1305,
you do not need to guarantee that every message has a unique number or
random initialization vector -- though if you have one you can put it
in the header to improve security by concealing when payloads are
repeated.

Then, as long as you and your friend encrypt no more than 2^52 messages
(or 2^90/L messages, if you and your friend can agree on a smaller
limit L < 2^38 on the number of bytes in each message):

- An adversary has no hope of distinguishing authenticated ciphertexts
  from uniform random noise -- except for noticing when you repeat the
  same (header, payload) pair under the same key.  (You can prevent
  adversaries from detecting repeated messages by putting a message
  sequence number or just randomization in the header or payload, for
  example.)

- An adversary has no hope of fooling your friend into accepting a
  payload and a header you did not send.  (Daence can also serve to
  authenticate messages without encryption if you simply specify an
  empty payload.)

Salsa20-Daence provides good performance and high security, and admits
a short implementation in terms of three primitives available in NaCl
and libsodium -- crypto_onetimeauth_poly1305, crypto_core_hsalsa20,
and crypto_stream_xsalsa20.  (The ChaCha-Daence variant is defined in
terms of parts that a ChaCha/Poly1305 implementation is likely to have
around, and has a smaller 64-byte key.)

Daence won't beat speed records for ChaCha/Poly1305, NaCl
crypto_secretbox_xsalsa20poly1305, or (hardware-accelerated) AES-GCM --
but who cares about speed when you accidentally repeated a nonce and
thereby leaked all your data to the adversary, including the key to
forgery?

## Building the specification and testing the implementation

You will need [libsodium](https://libsodium.org/),
[BearSSL](https://bearssl.org), and a TeX distribution.  Run

```
make
```

and let me know if anything goes wrong.  If it worked, you should have
a shiny new copy of the definition and analysis in `daence.pdf`, and
evidence that the reference implementation worked on your machine too.


## Measuring performance with [SUPERCOP](https://bench.cr.yp.to/)

Extract the SUPERCOP and symlink the Daence directories into it:

```
cd /path/to/supercop-YYYYMMDD
ln -s /path/to/daence/crypto_aead/salsa20daence crypto_aead/.
ln -s /path/to/daence/crypto_auth/salsa20daence crypto_auth/.
```

Now run SUPERCOP, as <https://bench.cr.yp.to/supercop.html> explains.

Running all of SUPERCOP takes a long time.  If you want to measure just
Salsa20-Daence, you will first need:

```
./do-part init
./do-part used
```

or at least:

```
./do-part init
./do-part crypto_verify 16
./do-part crypto_verify 32
./do-part crypto_core salsa20
./do-part crypto_core hsalsa20
./do-part crypto_stream salsa20
./do-part crypto_stream xsalsa20
./do-part crypto_onetimeauth poly1305
```

Then you can measure crypto_aead/salsa20daence or
crypto_auth/salsa20daence:

```
./do-part crypto_aead salsa20daence
./do-part crypto_auth salsa20daence
```

Raw output will be in: ```./bench/`hostname`/data```

(Plotting data left as an exercise for the conspiratorially-minded
reader.)
